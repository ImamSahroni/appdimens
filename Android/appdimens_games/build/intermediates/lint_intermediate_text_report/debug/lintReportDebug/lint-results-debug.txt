    implementation("androidx.annotation:annotation:1.7.1")
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

    testImplementation("org.robolectric:robolectric:4.11.1")
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NewerVersionAvailable":
   This detector checks with a central repository to see if there are newer
   versions available for the dependencies used by this project. This is
   similar to the GradleDependency check, which checks for newer versions
   available in the Android SDK tools and libraries, but this works with any
   MavenCentral dependency, and connects to the library every time, which
   makes it more flexible but also much slower.

   Explanation for issues of type "Aligned16KB":
   Android has traditionally used 4 KB memory page sizes. However, to support
   future devices that only work with 16 KB aligned libraries apps containing
   native libraries need to be built with 16 KB alignment.

   Apps with 4 KB aligned native libraries may not work correctly on devices
   requiring 16 KB alignment. To ensure compatibility and future-proof your
   app, it is strongly recommended that your native libraries are aligned to
   16 KB boundaries.

   If your app uses any NDK libraries, directly or indirectly through an SDK,
   you should rebuild your app to meet this recommendation. Make sure all
   native libraries within your application, including those from
   dependencies, are built with 16 KB page alignment.

   This lint check looks at all native libraries that your app depends on. If
   any are found to be aligned to 4 KB instead of 16 KB, you will need to
   address this.

   When a library is flagged, first try to update to a newer version that
   supports 16 KB alignment. If an updated version is not available, contact
   the library vendor to ask about their plans for 16 KB support and request a
   compatible version. Updating your libraries proactively will help ensure
   your app works properly on a wider range of devices.

        @Volatile
        ^

   Explanation for issues of type "StaticFieldLeak":
   A static field will leak contexts.

   Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class.
   If that outer class is for example a Fragment or Activity, then this
   reference means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a
   reference to the activity which prevents it from getting garbage
   collected.

   Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these
   longer running instances can cause leaks.

   ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts.

    testImplementation("org.robolectric:robolectric:4.11.1")
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UseTomlInstead":
   If your project is using a libs.versions.toml file, you should place all
   Gradle dependencies in the TOML file. This lint check looks for version
   declarations outside of the TOML file and suggests moving them (and in the
   IDE, provides a quickfix to performing the operation automatically).
